**Graphs**

Here we will learn about Graphs in Java. Graphs can be implemented in many ways either Adjacency Matrix or Using Adjacency List. 
There are many types of Graphs 
1) Direct Graph
2) Simple Digraph
3) Non Directed Graph
4) Non Connected Graph
5) Strongly Connected Graph 
6) Directed Acyclic Graph 


**Graphs are represented either in Adjacency Matrix or in Adjacency List**
Programs covered are :

1) Java Program to convert Adjacency List to Adjacency Matrix
2) Java Program to convert Adjacency Matrix to Adjacency List
3) Java Program to do BFS traversal of a Graph Iterative Method
